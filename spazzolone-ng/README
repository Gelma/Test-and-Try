spazzolone-ng: A replacement for spazzolone
============================================

spazzolone-ng is a replacement for spazzolone, it's written in python
to fetch and analyze data of the italian LUGs.


Requirements
------------
It require:
- python >= 2.6
- httplib2 - https://code.google.com/p/httplib2/
- zodb - http://www.zodb.org/

File description
----------------
check.py - contains the function to fetch the LUGs' data and the
           function launched in the multiprocess 
config.py - contains the config variables such as how many process must
            be launched to fetch the LUGs' data
lug.py - contains the class LUG, the one stored in ZODB
utils.py - contains all the utiliy functions such as read_db or
           zodb_conn_open
spazzolone.py - contains the main


How it works
------------
spazzolone-ng reads the LUGs' data from the lug database (utils.read_db),
the database is composed of .txt files in the './db/' (config.LUG_DB)
directory (one file for each region), every row in a db file is a LUG
entry, the row MUST be in this format:
Provice|Name|Zone|URL of the lug website|email address of the contact

All the data read from the lug_db database is inserted in a queue (lug_db_q),
then spazzolone-ng start N (config.P_NUMBER) process (check.mp_fill_lug)
which take the info from lug_db_q, proceed to fetch the data from the lug
website and puts the results in the result queue (lug_data_q).

Once all the data from the LUG websites are fetched, spazzolone-ng
read from the result queue (lug_data_q) and reports back those
containing errors.

Todo
----
- implement the send_report function in utils.py
- implement the check of the title
- clean the debug code used during the first writing of spazzolone-ng
- beautify the report
- now it doesn't use logit, so no syslog log are generated
- now I don't use volatile variables in LUG, maybe should I?
- comment the code
- fix the grammar of the README/comments :P
